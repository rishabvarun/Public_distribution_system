# **Public Distribution Sytsem**

This is a project which simulates online Public Distribution System (PDS) in India. It is a step taken towards a smart digital India, by making smart ration cards and online PDS portal inorder to reduce the malpractices in the current system.
There are three entities in this system ration card holder (consumer), distributor and the government
Here the distributor can only add stock which is updated only when the ration card holder withdraws his ration from the Fair Price Shop (FPS). The ration card holder is assigned an RFID smart card which replaces the conventional paper ration cards. There is a government system which can send circulars as well as monitor the working of the FPS.
The documentation(SRS, sequence diagrams, class diagrams) for the project is included.
