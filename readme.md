#**Public Distribution Sytsem**

This is a project which simulates the public distribution system in India. It is a step taken towards a smart digital India, by making
smart ration cards and online PDS portal inorder to reduce the malpractices in the current system. Here the distributor can only add stock
which is updated only when the ration card holder withdraws his ration from the Fair Price Shop (FPS). The ration card holder is assigned an
RFID smart card which replaces the conventioncal paper ration cards. There is a government system which can send circulars as well as monitor
the working of the FPS.
The documentation(SRS, sequence diagrams, class diagrams) for the project is included.
